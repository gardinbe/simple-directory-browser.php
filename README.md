# simple index.php
This is just a small alternative index.php to ones given by most web development environments, but I think it looks nicer.

Put it in the same directory as the directory used for your VirtualHost.

Note - make sure that 'open_basedir' in 'php.ini' is set to the location of your VirtualHost directory only if
you really don't want people looking in forbidden directories.
